<h1>PyDSTool v0.83.3</h1>

<p>September 2006. <i>This is a beta release version.</i></p>

<hr><br>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>See the online <a href='http://pydstool.sourceforge.net'>wiki</a> site,
particularly the GettingStarted page!
</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>Full API documentation can be found locally <a href='./doc/index.html'>here</a>, and
further documentation and discussion is provided on the
<a href='http://www.cam.cornell.edu/~rclewley/PyDSTool/'>wiki</a> site.</p>

<h3>Tests and examples</h3>
<p>Tests and examples can be found in the /tests/ directory. Some tests can only be run once others have
produced their output, for instance HH_loaded.py, HH_loaded_dopri.py, imp_load_test.py. Several of the examples
require an external compiler. An easy way to run all the tests in an appopriate order is to run the script
'run_all_tests.py' in the /tests/ directory. There is a simple option in that file that you may need to
edit in order to select whether the external compiler tests should be run (in case you do not have gcc
working on your system). Note that on some platforms you will see an error report when the script tries to
automatically close matplotlib graph windows, to the effect of:

"Fatal Python error: PyEval_RestoreThread: NULL tstate".

This error can be ignored. You may also have to close the plot windows yourself before the script can continue.
This will depend on your platform and settings.</p>

<p>Source files in the installation root directory also contain basic tests of their own functions. Just
execute the files as if they were scripts.</p>

<h3>Change histories</h3>
<p>Version change histories appear in the headers of each source file. An overview of the changes
in a new release can be found in the SourceForge release notes.</p>
